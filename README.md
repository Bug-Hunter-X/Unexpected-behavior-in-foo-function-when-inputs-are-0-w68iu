# Unexpected Behavior in foo function when inputs are 0

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: incorrect handling of null values.  The `foo` function is intended to add two numbers, but it incorrectly handles the case where both inputs are 0, treating them as null and returning 0 instead of the expected sum.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.js` demonstrates a corrected version.
